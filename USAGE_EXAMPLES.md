Hi {founder_name},

I noticed your company is building something interesting in the B2B space. 

We've built a tool that automates customer support requests (refunds, queries) across all channels so your team can focus on building instead of answering the same questions repeatedly.

Would you be interested in a quick 10-minute chat to see if this could help your team?

Best,
Saarth

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Data Collection
Always run Option 1 first to build your database, then use Option 2 for targeted campaigns.

### 2. Use Specific Filters
More specific filters = more relevant prospects = higher response rates.

### 3. Personalize Your Message
Use the custom email body option to tailor your message to specific industries or company stages.

### 4. Monitor Your Database
Check your Google Sheets regularly to see your growing prospect database.

### 5. Respect Rate Limits
The tool includes built-in delays - don't try to bypass them.

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

- **Email Sending**: Only works if you've completed Gmail API setup
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Companies are never processed twice (based on YC slug)
- **Data Persistence**: Everything is stored in Google Sheets - no local files to lose
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays respect YC and Gmail servers
- **Error Handling**: Failed operations are logged and don't stop the entire process

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

Track these metrics in your Google Sheets:
- **Total Companies**: Growing database size
- **Email Discovery Rate**: % of companies with emails found
- **Email Send Success**: % of emails successfully delivered
- **Response Rate**: Track manually or via email analytics

Happy outreaching! ðŸš€
